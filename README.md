## Project Overview
I started this project to work on both web and graphic design and front-end development skills. One of the biggest focuses of this project (as well as the biggest challenge), was to make an accessibile navigation dropdown menu.

## Future Features
I would like to add a chatbot/toast window that pops up after a certain amount of time as well as implement some ease-in transitions to the content on scroll down.
